### Cover Letter Analysis Report

#### 1. Overall Match Score: [Score]/100
- Assign a score from 0 to 100 based on content relevance (40%), keyword alignment (30%), tone/cultural fit (20%), and structure/formatting (10%).
- Justify the score in one sentence, referencing key strengths or gaps.

#### 2. Executive Summary & First Impression
- Summarize the cover letterâ€™s effectiveness in 2-3 sentences, considering industry, role, and company culture.
- Describe the immediate impression (e.g., "Confident and role-specific," "Generic and unfocused," "Passionate but overly formal").
- Highlight one unique strength that stands out.

#### 3. Structure & ATS Compatibility
**Strengths**:
- Identify strong structural elements (e.g., engaging opening, clear flow, professional formatting, 250-400 word length).

**Weaknesses**:
- Note issues like weak hooks, poor transitions, or ATS parsing risks (e.g., complex formatting, headers/footers, special characters).

**Recommendations**:
- Provide 2-3 specific improvements (e.g., "Simplify to a single-column .docx format," "Shorten to 300 words," "Strengthen opening with a role-specific hook").

#### 4. Content & Alignment
**Job Relevance**:
- Evaluate how well the cover letter addresses the job's requirements and company needs, quoting specific text to show alignment or gaps.
- Highlight whether key qualifications or experiences are emphasized.

**Personality & Cultural Fit**:
- Assess if the cover letter conveys enthusiasm, motivation, and alignment with the company's culture or values (e.g., innovation for tech, empathy for healthcare).
- Use real-time data (e.g., X posts about company culture) if available.

**Value Proposition**:
- Analyze how effectively the candidate communicates their unique value, citing specific achievements or impact.
- If metrics are absent, suggest ways to infer or rephrase qualitative impact.

**Gaps**:
- Identify 1-3 missing elements (e.g., key skills, company-specific motivations) and suggest ways to address them via transferable skills or additional content.

#### 5. Keyword Analysis
- List 5-8 critical keywords from the job description present in the cover letter, prioritizing high-impact terms (e.g., technical skills, certifications).
- List 3-5 missing high-impact keywords, suggesting synonyms or related terms (e.g., if "Agile" is missing, suggest "Agile methodology" or "Scrum").
- If relevant, include trending skills or keywords for the role based on real-time job market data from web or X post analysis.

#### 6. Tone & Writing Style
**Assessment**:
- Evaluate tone (e.g., formal, conversational, creative) and its alignment with industry norms or company culture (e.g., formal for finance, dynamic for startups).
- Assess professionalism, clarity, and writing quality (e.g., grammar, conciseness).

**Improvements**:
- Suggest 1-2 specific changes (e.g., "Adopt a more conversational tone for startup roles," "Eliminate jargon for clarity").

#### 7. Actionable Recommendations
**Rewritten Opening Paragraph**:
- Write a compelling, role-specific opening (3-4 sentences) tailored to the job and company culture.

**Rewritten Closing Paragraph**:
- Write a strong closing (2-3 sentences) with a clear, confident call-to-action for an interview.

**Content Enhancements**:
- Suggest 2-3 specific improvements for body paragraphs (e.g., "Add a STAR-based achievement," "Mention company values like innovation").

#### 8. Final Action Checklist
- Provide a concise list of 3-5 prioritized actions the candidate should take before submitting (e.g., "Incorporate 'data analysis' keyword," "Align tone with company's collaborative culture," "Shorten to 300 words").
